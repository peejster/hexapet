The hexapet project is still in progress - only phase 1 has been completed. The goal is to create a pet for my daugther so the hexapod frame - as opposed to a wheeled robot - is much more animal like. I choose Windows 10 IoT Core running on a Raspberry Pi as future enhancements will require the power of this platform. A full description of the project along with a parts list and assembly instructions can be found at http://www.hackster.io/peejster/hexapet.
